<main>
    <p>I'm David Quintanilla, currently working towards a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering at Kennesaw State University. 
        Originally from Nicaragua, I was raised in Henry County, Georgia. Open to new opportunities and collaborations, 
        I take pride in being a dedicated and dependable worker.
          </p>
    <p class = "underline">Experience and Skills</p>
    <p> 
        I possess proficiency in C#, Java, and Python, with a primary focus on backend languages like SQL. 
        Additionally, I have a foundational understanding of HTML and CSS, as I created this website using these technologies.
         I am eager to broaden my skill set by delving into new programming languages and further refining my expertise in those I already know. 
         Being bilingual in English and Spanish adds another layer to my communication abilities.
          Currently, I am actively engaged in pursuing a Meta Back-End Developer Professional Certificate on Coursera, 
          aiming to deepen my knowledge in Python and SQL, while also gaining insights into the Django framework, APIs, and more. </p>
